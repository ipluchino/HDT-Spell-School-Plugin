# HDT-Spell-School-Tracker-Plugin

A basic Hearthstone Deck Tracker plugin that displays a list of all currently unique casted spell schools. Works with all current cards (as of Hearthstone Patch 27.2).

This is the first time I've worked with code for an HDT plugin and credit for the initial logic/syntax goes to:
https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Creating-Plugins - Basic Tutorial <br />
https://github.com/slicedbread/HDT-SpellSchoolCounter-Plugin - Old Spell School Plugin <br /> 

NOTE: Got most of the idea/plugin code syntax from the plugin above that no longer worked with the current standard set of cards, and originally worked only when highlighting certain cards from your hand. Also added the spell school type next to the card since I was not able to always easily determine a spell's type by only its name.
